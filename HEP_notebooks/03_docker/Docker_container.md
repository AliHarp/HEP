# Hospital Efficiency Project containerisation using Docker


An example image for deploying the model in a container is hosted on Dockerhub instructions at:

https://hub.docker.com/r/tommonks01/hep-sim


GitHub repo with simulation code, build scripts and tests: https://github.com/TomMonks/hep-deploy

Containers provide a consistent andisolated runtime environment for running  applications,  ensuring  that  they  behave  the  same  way  across  different  computing  environment.
